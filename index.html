        <div class="subheading mb-5">Psychology Major</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">After graduating elementary, middle, and high school in Redlands, I had my eyes set on attending a UC. Despite being rejected from UCSD, UCI, and UCLA, UCR outright accepted me. I am extremely grateful for this. I am currently a student at UCR who plans to hopefully graduate on time with a B.S. in Psychology. It is my first year attending a university and I have, for the most part, been able to adapt to the new environment. I am currently not working and intend on focusing on my education first. The classes I'm taking include Psychology 002, Math 3, and Computer Science 8. Even with registration right around the corner, I'm still quite unfamiliar with what courses are offered and how UCR operates in general, unfortunately.<br><br>

        I'm being completely honest when I say this, I absolutely have no professional experience in anything right now. I know the assignment tells me to talk about my professional experience, but man, it's hard to write about something you basically know nothing about. Just to reach the minimum of 500 words for the assignment, I'll just be talking about things that I've basically done in my life, but in regards to the arts and classes I've taken previously. So I've been in choir, orchestra, jazz band, and theatre. On side, I've drawn, composed, and performed in my free time. I'm typically not a great fan of making myself known on the internet as an artist because people tend to be vicious, even when there's really no reason to be. Anyways, the only experience I've had with showing my art publically has been on a few occations where I've posted my art on Tumblr, Instagram, Google Plus, Toy House, and Art Fight. I've been drawing since I was about 5 years old. I still remember making my first ever comic in 1st grade. It really wasn't until I was in 4th and 5th grade that my interest really grew. I'm still going strong with my interest in art since I've participated in Art Fight for about 4 years already. For context, Art Fight is an online team-based competition between artists and the main goal is to score as many points as possible by drawing the other team's characters. Both quality and quantity of art will determine how many points you will be able to earn for your team. Anyways, aside from just drawing, I've got experience with being involved in the performing arts. I've played piano for about 13 years now, the violin for 3, and the guitar for 2. I've got experience with percussion instruments, mostly with the bells and vibraphone.<br><br>

        What I'm planning on doing in the future is to become either a psychiatrist or a nurse practitioner. Maybe as a side gig, I'll consider writing a few books since I really enjoy engaging in creative writing in my free time. I think my main concern for the future is not only having to do a bunch of job interviews, but finding workplace that's local or at least within driving distance. Of course, all of this thinking will apply more in the future rather than now, but still.
